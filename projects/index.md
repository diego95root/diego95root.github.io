---

This is a collection of the retired boxes I've solved in Hack The Box. I wanted to give back something to the community and maybe this is a good resource for those who like reading and are interested in pentesting. You can find the writeups on [github](https://github.com/diego95root/HackTheBox) or on my [blog](https://diego95root.github.io/tags/#Hack The Box).

This is a simple tool which allows to establish a reverse shell from a hardened machine by using ICMP packets. It offers different modes of exfiltration to avoid detection. You can check it out on [github](https://github.com/diego95root/ICMP-backdoor).
